This is the first draft of Chronus architecture so it's a RFC.

1 Modules

There must be three main modules working in some kind of client-server mode
being them the Chronos data server, Chronos GUI and CLI.

1.1 Chronos Data server
It must be a daemon, so it's always available. It stores data and accept dbus
connections from any client, being it the CLI, calendar applets, or the main
GUI.

1.2 Chronos GUI
The main Chronos Graphical interface.

1.3 Chronos CLI client
It's an easy CLI client to Chronos data server, It can be used to request or
add information without the need of a X11 environment.

2 Communication

The communication between each front end and the Chronos Data Server will be
done through dbus using some standard API (we need to take a look at fdo to
find something there or create a new one that must be purposed to fdo).
